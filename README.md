# Project Title: Sentiment Forecasting in Tweets Using Long Short-Term Memory Model with MongoDB for Big Data Storage and Processing

## Overview
The "Sentiment Forecasting in Tweets" project aims to utilize advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, to accurately predict sentiment trends in social media tweets. This predictive model will be supported by MongoDB, a robust NoSQL database, serving as the primary technology for big data storage and processing. The project addresses the growing need for real-time sentiment analysis in various sectors, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on public sentiment, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer engagement.

## Objectives

Develop an Accurate Predictive Model: Utilize LSTM to create a model capable of forecasting sentiment scores based on historical tweet data and other relevant factors.
Leverage Big Data: Implement MongoDB to efficiently store, manage, and process vast amounts of tweet data, sentiment scores, and associated metadata.
Benchmark Database Performance: Conduct comparative analysis of MongoDB and MySQL using YCSB to evaluate performance across various workloads and data sizes.
Methodology

### 1.  Data Collection and Storage:

Collect tweets in real-time to capture shifting sentiments. Utilize MongoDB to store this data, benefiting from its flexibility and scalability for unstructured data.
Sentiment Extraction and Analysis:

### 2. Text Processing: Preprocess tweet text to remove noise and prepare for sentiment analysis.
- Sentiment Analysis: Use TextBlob and VADER sentiment analysis tools to extract polarity and subjectivity scores. TextBlob facilitates language translation, while VADER effectively handles social media-specific language.
- Vectorization: Transform text data into numerical matrices using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer for input into machine learning models.

### 3. Database Benchmarking with YCSB:
- Conduct a comparative analysis of MongoDB and MySQL performance using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB), simulating different workload scenarios and request distributions to assess efficiency and scalability.

### 4. Model Development and Training:
Develop and train the LSTM and autoregressive models on the sentiment data stored in MongoDB. Utilize the Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes classifier for preliminary sentiment classification based on vectorized data.

### 5. Evaluation and Validation:
Assess the performance of sentiment prediction models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to ensure accuracy and generalizability.

### 6. Expected Outcomes

Accurate Sentiment Predictions: Achieve high accuracy in predicting sentiment trends, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions based on public opinion.
Optimized Marketing Strategies: Provide valuable insights to businesses and marketers, allowing them to tailor campaigns according to prevailing sentiments.
Scalable Big Data Solution: Develop a scalable architecture using MongoDB that can efficiently handle large volumes of tweet data and provide real-time analytics.
Robust Database Performance Insights: Gain valuable insights into the performance of MongoDB versus MySQL, guiding future database selection and optimization strategies.

### 7. Conclusion
The "Sentiment Forecasting in Tweets" project integrates advanced machine learning techniques with powerful big data technologies to address the complexities of real-time sentiment analysis. By harnessing the capabilities of LSTM models and MongoDB, this project aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and accurate predictive system that supports stakeholders in making data-driven decisions and optimizing their strategies in an ever-changing digital landscape.
